NAME
    Test::Mock::LWP - Easy mocking of LWP packages

SYNOPSIS

Make LWP packages to make testing easier.

    use Test::Mock::LWP;

    # Setup fake response content and code
    $Mock_response->mock( content => sub { 'foo' } );
    $Mock_resp->mock( code => sub { 201 } );

    # Validate args passed to request constructor
    is_deeply $Mock_request->new_args, \@expected_args;
    
    # Validate request headers
    is_deeply [ $Mock_req->next_call ],
              [ 'header', [ 'Accept', 'text/plain' ] ];

    # Special User Agent Behaviour
    $Mock_ua->mock( request => sub { die 'foo' } );

DESCRIPTION

This package arises from duplicating the same code to mock LWP et al in
several different modules I've written.  This version is very minimalist, but
works for my needs so far.  I'm very open to new suggestions and improvements.
